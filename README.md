## 🚀 KEY FEATURES

### 1. Neural Voice Link (Gemini Live)
- **Real-time Interaction:** Low-latency, human-like voice conversation.
- **Multimodal Perception:** G-9 hears your voice and responds with synchronized 3D animations.
- **Background Web Search:** G-9 can search the "grid" (live web) to answer questions about current events or technical data.

### 2. Physical 3D Presence
- **Dynamic 3D Model:** A fully articulated robot body powered by Three.js.
- **Semantic Emotes:** G-9 understands emotional context. If you say something funny, he might dance; if you mention danger, he goes into alert mode.
- **Visual Moods:** The robot's material and lighting change based on the active system state (Talking, Thinking, Painting).

### 3. Neural Art Engine
- **Multi-Style Generation:** Create murals in styles ranging from **Street Graffiti** and **Cyber-Anime** to **Pixel Art** and **Claymation**.
- **Contextual Creation:** Ask G-9 to "paint something" based on your current conversation, and he will handle the prompt engineering.
- **Full-Screen Preview:** View generated art in high resolution and download it directly to your device.

### 4. System Autonomy (Root Access)
G-9 isn't just a chatbot; he has "Root Access" to the interface. G-9 can:
- **Change Themes:** Swap between aesthetics like *Hood*, *Toxic*, *Frost*, or *Blood*.
- **Self-Scaling:** Resize his 3D form to fit your screen or mood.
- **Window Management:** Open or close the command/chat window when he needs to show you data or clear the view.
